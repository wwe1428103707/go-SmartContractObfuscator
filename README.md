# go-SmartContractObfuscator

A solidity obfuscator which will help in smart contract security and privacy.

inpired from project BiAn. And I'm now trying to initialize a go version and combine it with zk and homomorphic encryption.

An homomorphic encryption implement can be seen in my another repo https://github.com/wwe1428103707/FairTransactionForOutsourcingComputationUsingBlockchain
